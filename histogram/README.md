# TL;DR: [this program](./main.py)

AKA "Who needs Lotus 123?"

Not much to say about this one.

I didn't observe the limits as given in the task descrption very closely.
As a result, the input can be longer than 1000 entries, but must end with an EOF.
The value range may also exceed 0~10, but the offset from the left edge may be affected.
